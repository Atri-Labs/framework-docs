Atri framework is a full-stack web development framework to build Progressive Web Apps.

- Frontend development: Use our visual editor to increase your productivity. You can also add your custom React code.
- Backend development: Currently, we support Python for backend development. We are planning to add support for NodeJS soon. 
- Deployment support: Our CLI provides rich support for easy deployment at your platform of choice such as GitHub Pages, AWS, etc. 

## What can I build using this framework?

Atri is a general purpose framework that can be used to build everything from e-commerce websites to internal apps.

## How is Atri framework different from other web development frameworks?

1. Atri framework is not just limited to the JavaScript world. You can use this framework with many languages such as Python, NodeJS (upcoming), etc.
2. Atri framework comes with a suite of productivity tools such as visual editor, asset management tools, etc. that significantly reduce development time from months to hours.
3.  Using Atri framework, developers do not need to write and document REST APIs. Instead, they rely upon the object model which acts as a single source of truth. This also has other benefits as well such as reducing compliance breaches. 

Thus, Atri framework is extending the definition of full-stack to include non web developers in the development and maintenance of an app. 

## Objectives of the framework
This framework aims to improve the experience of website development for developers. It enhances the developer productivity by adapting to the best possible ways. We are committed to achieve the following objectives via this framework:

- Increase developer productivity
- Adopt Progressive Web App (PWA) specifications strictly
- Easy to adapt to compliances

## Design Principles
The following points provide a guiding post when major design decisions are taken for the framework:

- Keep the frontend code as light as possible.
- The backend API is simple and flexible.
- Follow "What you see - What you get".
