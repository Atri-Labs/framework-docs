title: Custom Panel
description: Adding custom properties to a component
---
This panel contains custom properties that are specific to each component. 

For example, a `Button` component has a custom property `text`. By default, it is set to 'Submit'. However, we can make changes here if we want the button text to be 'Click Me'.  

The custom panel for each component is covered in the [Reference](/category/component-reference/).
