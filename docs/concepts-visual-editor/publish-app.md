Once we are happy with our work in the canvas, we can publish our app.  

There are three key things to note here:

1. We can keep reviewing our incremental work by clicking the `Publish` button instead of publishing the app only when it's fully ready. 

2. It may take longer to build our app when we are publishing it for the first time.

3. Everytime we publish our app, the changes reflect instantly in the app when we refresh.
