All the apps created using this editor are responsive, i.e. they accomodate and adjust according to the screen size. 

We can also check how our app will look when opened in a different screen type. The `breakpoints` section in the center of the top menu provides four screen types:

- Desktop
- Tablet
- Mobile landscape
- Mobile portrait

The default mode in which we create our frontend is `Desktop`.
