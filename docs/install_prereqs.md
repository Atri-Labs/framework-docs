### Install Python 3.7+

The Atri framework supports Python 3.7+. If you don't have Python installed already please download latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install virtual environment package

We enforce best practices for app development, hence, `atri` CLI works only from inside a virtual environment. We currently support two virtual environment packages - `pipenv`(preferred) and `conda`.

#### Install Pipenv (preferred)

```
pip install --user pipenv
```

#### Or install Conda

Please visit [this link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation) to `conda`.
