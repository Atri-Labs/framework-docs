Using the Atri framework, we can create multi-page apps. 

Each page has the following associated information:

- Page Name: The unique identifier used to refer to the page
- Folder Name: It's sometimes helpful to categorize a set of pages inside a folder
- Slug: The unique identifying phrase added at the end of a web address to refer to the page. E.g. the slug of this page is `concepts-visual-editor/page-manager` added to the end of the URL [https://docs.atrilabs.com/](https://docs.atrilabs.com/).
