title: Create Media Response
description: A function of the media-response file in atri-utils
---

### UseCase
The `create_media_response` function can be used to convert `file` or `image-data` into a format which can be used by `Atri-engine's` Image Component


For example, you have to show a resultant image generated by your model/project, and you want to display it on the frontend you just have to follow 3 simple steps:-



:::info
Example which we are using refers to a file uploaded by the user and wants to display it on the screen
:::info



##### 1. Make sure atri-utils is imported on the top as:

```python
from atri_utils import *
```

##### 2. Code for the main.py to show the Uploaded Image on the frontend

```python
def handle_event(at: Atri, req: Request, res: Response):
    if at.Upload1.onChange:
        if at.Upload1.io.files != None:
            file = at.Upload.io.files[0]
            at.Image.custom.src = create_media_response(file.file.read(), mime_type=file.content_type)
```


##### 3. Now from the Frontend of the published app click on the Upload button and upload a valid image it will show up in the Image component specified


Note :- This function can be used with multiple data types including `bytes`, `filepath`, `BinaryIO`
