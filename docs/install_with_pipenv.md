### Create a Project Directory

Create an empty directory. This directory will contain all the files for your app. You can create this empty directory anywhere in your repository. In this example, we are creating a directory called `my_app`. You can choose any name for this directory.

```
mkdir my_app
```

### Install `atri` CLI

From inside the app directory, `my_app` in this example, run the following command:

```
cd my_app
pipenv install atri
```

### Next Steps

Congratulations! Atri framework has been successfully installed. 

Let us now [start the Atri engine](/docs/start-engine.md).
