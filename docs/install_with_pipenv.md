### Create a Project Directory

Create an empty directory anywhere in your repository. It will later contain all the files for your app. In this example, we are creating a directory called `my_app`. You can choose any name for this directory.

```
mkdir my_app
```

### Install `atri` CLI

From inside the project directory, `my_app` in this example, run the following command:

```
cd my_app
pipenv install atri
```

### Next Steps

Congratulations! Atri framework has been successfully installed. 

Let us now [start the Atri engine](/docs/start-engine.md).
