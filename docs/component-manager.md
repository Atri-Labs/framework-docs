Using the Atri framework, we can create frontend of our app using different components. 

The `Component Manager` lists all the components that can be added to our app. 

There are three categories of components:

- Layout: Components required to arrange other components in an app. E.g. Flex box to make the app responsive, etc. 
- Basics: Components required in any general-purpose app. E.g. button, input box, etc.
- Data: Components required to display data. E.g. pie chart, bar chart, etc. 

We can visit the `Component Manager` to add any component to our app.
