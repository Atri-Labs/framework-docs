1. Stop the current development session by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the Terminal.

2. Run `atri start --debug` instead to get detailed error messages in your Terminal. 

3. Recreate the process where you were facing an error. 

4. Check if your error has already been asked before [here](https://github.com/Atri-Labs/atrilabs-engine/discussions/categories/help-installation-start). Else, submit a new Discussion.
